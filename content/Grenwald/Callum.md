**Race**: Unidentified Humanoid

**Curse**: Leprosy

**Appearance**: He is 4'10" with a starved physique. He is ghoul-like in appearance, with seemingly no muscle at all. Thin and frail, his body seemingly lacks the ability to support itself. His skin is always discolored and sickly. He is most often found on Bolg's back.

**Backstory**: Callum was an outcast in the town of Inkwater. Hailing from a long line of revered intellectuals, Callum takes after his predecessors with a hunger for knowledge. Although his intelligence may surpass even that of his ancestors, Callum was so ugly due to his Leprosy that he was often overlooked or cast aside. That was until he met Bolg, who shared all of his interests and possessed the brutish strength to stand up for him. This resulted in a quick friendship that evolved into a deep bond.

**Notes**  
-Callum has proven that he can walk on his own, hopping down off of Bolg's back to stand on his own two feet every so often.
