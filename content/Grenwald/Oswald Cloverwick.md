**Race**: Harengon

**Curse**: Lethargy

**Appearance**: He is 5'11 and slightly overweight. His curse is reflected in his appearance, with a chubby physique and saggy ears. His right eye appears to have been removed with a knife, leaving a nasty scar. He has white fur that has been caked in stained by various liquids, resulting in discoloration and fading. He wears tattered leather clothing and the collar of his shirt comes just up to this furless patch of skin on his neck which bares his peculiar curse mark.

**Backstory**: Once a member of a druidic circle somewhere in the forests, Oswald's issues came when a land ownership conflict arose. Colonizers came to settle in the druids' forest, resulting in a violent turf war. Apathetic to the struggle, Oswald decided not to help the druids retain the land. For this they labeled him a traitor, cutting out his right eye and exiling him forever. Oswald survived on his own for a short while before attempting to return to his people. When he arrived home however, he found the forest ablaze. The foreigners had burned the forest down and forced the druids out for good.
