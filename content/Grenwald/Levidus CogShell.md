**Race**: Tortle

**Curse**: Shell Lesions

**Appearance**: He is 7'5" with a stouter build for a tortle. His skin and shell are a faded, swampy brown and green. His stout arms go down to jagged, yellowed  turtle claws, and his shell and back are speckled with massive lesions and pustules that leak blood, puss, and other mysteriously colored fluids.

**Backstory**: Born in a quiet coastal town, Levidus earned the name "CogShell" due to the odd machinery he would craft from both cogs and shells. His aptitude for engineering eventually caught the eyes of a rebel group seeking to overthrow an oppressive regime in their land, who then recruited Levidus. Levidus' creations were instrumental in rebel victories, garnering him both praise and fear. But eventually, the rebellion turned sour. What once was a group of rebels, had evolved into a violent terrorist group responsible for the deaths of many innocents. Levidus became disillusioned with his path, knowing that his creations were being used to harm his own people. Because of this, he disappeared from the limelight for many many years, seeking to find a new purpose. 

**Notes**  
-Levidus keeps a bag on his back full of trinkets. But, on occasion he also stuffs living beings and corpses into the same bag. The reason is unknown.
