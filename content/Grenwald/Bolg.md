Race: Goliath

Appearance: He is 8'8" and so misshapen that he is often mistaken for a troll or other similar monsters. His face is one that even a mother would struggle to love, and his body is lumpy and disproportionate. However, none of that can hide his stout, hulking physique. Most of the time he is carrying Callum on his back.

Backstory: Bolg was an outcast in the town of Inkwater, rejected and feared. However, his curiosity for discovery and reading lead him face to face with Callum. Due to a shared propensity for learning and status as rejects, they soon forged a symbiotic relationship which quickly evolved into a deep friendship.

Notes  
-Because he was rejected at such a young age even from cursed society, Bolg has issues socializing, resulting in an apparent absence of charisma and odd speech pattern.
-Bolg has monstrous strength and fighting ability, exhibiting the ability to crush goblins with his bare hands and the ability to carry up to five full oil barrels on his back.
