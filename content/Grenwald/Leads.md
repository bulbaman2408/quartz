The purpose of this page is to catalog any and all leads for ongoing questlines and mysteries as the story goes on in Grenwald. Use this for reference if you've forgotten how or why the party is doing something or if you want to know how the party ended up where they are. Leads are split into two categories: Quests and Mysteries. Use the hyperlink most relevant to your search.

[[Quests]]: Quests are missions with defined parameters and direction. They develop in the foreground and can be resolved with physical action.

[[Mysteries]]: Mysteries are classified as any absence of information that results in reasonable intrigue, that can only be resolved upon discovery of relevant information.
