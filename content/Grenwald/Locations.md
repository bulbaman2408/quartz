--------------------------------------------------------------

**Baelson's Ghetto**  
-Baelson's Ghetto is wretched, city constructed in a boggy marsh nearby the capital city of Abernon. It could be considered the cursed capital of Grenwald, as it has the highest population of cursed individuals out of any city in the entire continent. Any cursed folk unlucky enough to be kicked from their hometown will most likely end up here.

**Abernen**  
-Abernen is the capital city of Grenwald and is ruled by Silas Von Vaughn. The city has a massive navy and has an economy that is primarily reliant on imports/exports.

Cursed individuals are treated like lower class individuals and are often kicked out of the city to Baelson's Ghetto.

**Grand Trenton**  
-Grand Trenton is the richest of all cities in Grenwald and is ruled by Atrum Trenton. Money will get you farther here than anything else.

**Iron Forge**  
-Iron Forge is led by Magnus Caizar. The city is sustained by various tradesmen, hunters, and the like. Cursed people are hated throughout the Iron Forge, considered to be less than nothing. Because of this, they are treated like slaves.

**Verrasold**

**Kerik Neverbrig**  
-Ruled by Veronica Oreborn, Kerik Neverbrig is built into the side of a large mountain. As such, Kerik Neverbrig has an economy based around mining valuable ores and minerals. Posessing the largest mine in all of Grenwald, traders flood in and out of the city.
